					<p>We’re proud to stock Frog Bikes, the best bikes for kids we've found. They’re lightweight and easy to handle,
						available in plenty of colours, and keep their value well for when kids grow out of them.</p>
					<p>For years kids have been riding bikes that weigh half their own body weight and are tiring to lug around. On a
						practical level, heavy bikes usually end up being left in the shed! Frogs are made of aluminium, a lightweight
						frame material - meaning they’re easier for kids to balance and control, not to mention faster.</p>

					<h2>Buying a Frog Bike from Lunar</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>We have free parking at the shop so it’s easy to take the bike home</li>
						<li>We offer free servicing on all Frog Bikes for a year (not including cleaning or replacing worn parts) - so
							it’s easy to keep your child riding all year round</li>
						<li>We stock lights and other accessories too like locks and kickstands</li>
						<li>All Frogs come with reflectors and a bell, mudgaurds and a spare set of off road tyres and tubes</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Test rides</h2>
					<p>Frog have a wide range of bikes for children and we have one of each size of the balance, first pedal and
						hybrid bikes in stock for your child to test ride. We have a wide range of colours in stock and if the colour
						your child wants isn’t in stock, we can order them in within 48 hours!</p>
					<p>We can also order in Frog’s road bikes and track bikes for more serious riders.</p>
					<h2>The bikes</h2>
					<h3>Balance bikes</h3>
					<p>Balance bikes are perfect for young children of 2-3 years old. They don't have any pedals and the child's feet
						are always able to touch the floor. This gives the child an innate sense of the balance needed to ride once
						they're ready for pedals - no more traumatic moments taking off the stabilisers. They also have a steering
						limiter so that the handlebars can't be turned too far - this is much safer when learning to ride.</p>
					<h3>First pedal bikes</h3>
					<p> Suitable for children aged 4-5 years old. Like the balance bikes, they come with a steering limiter. They come
						with mudguards as standard, and with two types of tyre - a hybrid tyre for every day use, and a knobby tyre for
						muddy rides along the canal or in the countryside.</p>
					<h3>Hybrid bikes</h3>
					<p>For most riders, this is everything you need. Available from age 5 up to age 14, they're made of aluminium and
						have flat handlebars and 8 speed gears with an easy thumb shifter. And like the first pedal bikes they come with
						mudguards and two types of tyre.</p>
