					<h2>Why an Emu Electric Bike?</h2>
					<p>All electric bikes are not equal. And there are a few things that make the Emu Electric Bike stand out…</p>
					<h2>The best looking e-bike</h2>
					<p>A retro frame and design features complement smooth welding and attention to detail, making Emu as smart to
						look
						at as it is fun to ride. This is thanks to the patented in-frame battery that not only looks great but also
						contributes to the balance and the smooth ride.</p>
					<p>A choice of four eye catching colours and a range of carefully chosen accessories, to ensure you always have a
						smile on your face when riding.</p>
					<h2>You got the power!</h2>
					<p>Emu’s battery will give you a range of 30-80km off one charge, and with 6 power settings - superb acceleration.
						You can choose how much of a workout you want, allowing you to move around cities or the countryside with ease.</p>
					<p>The removable quick-charging battery can be unlocked and charged in your home or office from a regular mains
						socket, leaving you safe to lock up your Emu at street level.</p>
					<h2>Savings direct to you</h2>
					<p>We’re committed to providing you with high quality E-bikes online. Emu is a British brand with bikes designed
						by leading experts in the UK and Europe to make the most stylish and featured packed electric bikes on the market
						today.
					</p>
					<p>You are buying direct and savings passed to you means you get the specification of a bike that might cost
						significantly more from our competitors. You can even split the cost into manageable payments, by the cycle to
						work schemes.</p>
					<h2>The smart electric bike</h2>
					<p>The Emu has an in-built USB port so you can charge your Smartphone whilst on the move. Your smartphone can give
						you the directions you need to navigate your way across town or the countryside.</p>
					<h2>Two-Wheel Power</h2>
					<p>The electric motor powers the front wheel pulling you forward, while you power the the rear wheel. This gives a
						natural balance, not found in designs using central or rear hub drives which unbalance the bike.</p>
					<h2>The best gear system</h2>
					<p>The Shimano Nexus 7 hub gear system is a proven and respected choice which has significant advantages over
						choosing a derailleur gear system. You can change gear at any point, not just when you are cycling, very useful
						at traffic lights and move directly from 7 to 1 or anywhere in between while you are cycling. You won’t
						experience the chain coming off and it will last significantly longer. The hub gear means all the mechanisms are
						protected from the elements, so won’t get dirty meaning a long service life.</p>
					<h2>Two-Year Warranty</h2>
					<p>Every Emu comes with a 2 year warranty on all major parts and is supported by Emu’s partner network giving
						access to a national network of qualified mobile mechanics who can visit you at your home or office, giving you
						complete peace of mind.</p>
